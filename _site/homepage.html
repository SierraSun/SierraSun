        <h1 class="EastBoston_head">Asthma is more likely for children living near Logan Airport</h1>

          <p>
            Does living close to the airport increase the risk of childhood asthma?
            According to <a href="http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/docs/dph/environmental/investigations/logan/logan-airport-health-study-final.pdf"> Logan Airport Health Study</a> (Conducted by Massachusetts
            Department of Public Health Bureau of Environmental Health), children who live in neighborhoods
            bordering Logan International Airport are as much as <font size="3rem" color="#f05f00">four times</font>
            more likely to wheeze, experience shortness of breath, and exhibit other signs
            of undiagnosed asthma compared with children who live farther away.</p>

          <p>
            From the chart above, we can tell that Boston area has a much higher rate of hospital admission for asthma.
            Therefore, how about the condition in East Boston, which near Logan airport?

          <b>Air pollutants –– the main trigger of pediatric asthma</b>
          </div>

          <p>
            The Massachusetts state had conducted a comprehensive environmental health assessment
            of Logan Airport. In the report, it examined the prevalence of respiratory outcomes
            among children for those living in <font size="3rem" color="#f05f00">three levels</font> airport-related air pollution exposure areas.
            <br><ur class="a">
              <li><font size="3rem" color="#442249"><b>High exposure:</b></font> Living in the areas where have high exposure to air pollutants due to the airport.</br></li>
            </ur>

            <ur class="b">
            <li><font size="3rem" color="#c23734"><b>Medium exposure:</b></font> Living in the areas where have medium exposure to air pollutants due to the airport.</li>
            </ur>
            <ur class="c">
            <li><font size="3rem" color="#f05f00"><b>Low exposure:</b></font> Living in the areas where have low exposure to air pollutants due to the airport.</li>
            </ur>
          </p>


          <p>
            The main air pollutants are comprised of <font size="3rem" color="#f05f00">PM2.5 and NOx</font>. Areas near Logan airport have higher concentration of NOx and PM2.5,
            which means <font size="3rem" color="#f05f00">you will have more exposure to the air pollutants when you live near Logan Airport</font>.
            You can see the map below:
          </p>
          <div style="text-align:center">
              <img src="css/images/map.svg" width="100%">
          </div>

          <p>
          Based on the study, a positive correlation between the exposure degree and the possibility to suffer from asthma
          has been found.
          </p>
          <div class="callout">
            <b>Children are more likely to have asthma when living in HIGH EXPOSURE area </b>

            <img src="css/images/finger.svg" style="margin-top:2%;width:250px;">

            <script type="text/javascript" src="js/bostonchart2.js"></script>
        </div>

        <p>
        As you can see from the chart, probable asthma are more prevalent in the high exposure areas
        than in the medium or low exposure areas. Similarly, the prevalence of chronic bronchitis
        increased as the potential for exposure increased. In sum, <font size="3rem" color="#f05f00">probable asthma or undiagnosed asthma,
        and chronic bronchitis have relation to the distance from Logan Airport.</font> However, current asthma
        among children is similar across all three exposure areas. In other words, <font size="3rem" color="#f05f00">there is no clear
        relationship between the current asthma of children and the distance from Logan Airport.</font>
